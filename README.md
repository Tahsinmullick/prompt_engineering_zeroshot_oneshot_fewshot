### Understanding prompt engineering through Zero Shot , One Shot and Few Shot Learning


> The notebook has code that uses the FLAN-T5 base model to perform the action of dialogue summarization.
> - The goal is to explore prompt engineering through a comparitive analysis of zero shot , one shot and few shot learning.
> - The role of **In-Context Learning** is investigated with supporting observations stated for clarity.
> - Lastly the role of **Token size**, **Temperature** is also experimented with.
> - The dataset is loaded from Hugging Face
